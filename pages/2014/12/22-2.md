_Disclaimer : I am not an angularjs or security expert. What I write here is based on my readings and foundings on the net. I also didn't read the full [OpenId connect spec](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html). So feel free to comment the articles and the code and I will try to keep it up to date._

This article talks about different open source project that you can use to build and protect your application. As there are lots of article speaking on angularjs, webapi2 and MVC my main focus point here is how to use the new [Thinktecture's IdentityServer v3](https://github.com/thinktecture/Thinktecture.IdentityServer.v3) to protect your application and allow external application (Client) to call your Api. (remember the "Do you allow XXXX to acces your _email_ and _profile_ _information_ and to have '_write_' access to your data?").

#### Parts

I splitted this article in multiple parts for clarity and will try to keep each part up to date as comments are coming in :

**[Part 1](http://cedric-dumont.com/tutorials/identityserver-v3-membershipreboot-angularjs-webapi-2-and-mvc-mix-it-introduction/identityserver-v3-membershipreboot-angularjs-webapi-2-and-mvc-mix-it-part-1/ "IdentityServer.v3, MembershipReboot, AngularJs, WebApi 2 and MVC : Mix It ! : Part 1") : **setting up and configure IdentityServer. IdentityServer will be used to authenticate user but also to authenticate Client and give them access to User's resource after they give them consent.

**[Part 2](http://cedric-dumont.com/tutorials/identityserver-v3-membershipreboot-angularjs-webapi-2-and-mvc-mix-it-introduction/identityserver-v3-membershipreboot-angularjs-webapi-2-and-mvc-mix-it-part-2/ "IdentityServer.v3, MembershipReboot, AngularJs, WebApi 2 and MVC : Mix It ! : Part 2") : **create our "private" API that will contain an accountController responsible for creating our users. The responsibility to authenticate them will be provided by IdentityServer.

[**Part 3**](http://cedric-dumont.com/tutorials/identityserver-v3-membershipreboot-angularjs-webapi-2-and-mvc-mix-it-introduction/identityserver-v3-membershipreboot-angularjs-webapi-2-and-mvc-mix-it-part-3/ "IdentityServer.v3, MembershipReboot, AngularJs, WebApi 2 and MVC : Mix It ! : Part 3") : creating a public Web API that will "expose" user's Resources. By user resources, I mean Products, Contacts, Orders ...

**[Part 4](http://cedric-dumont.com/identityserver-v3-membershipreboot-angularjs-webapi-2-and-mvc-mix-it-part-4/ "IdentityServer.v3, MembershipReboot, AngularJs, WebApi 2 and MVC : Mix It ! : Part 4") : **creating our angularjs Web UI which will allow us to Register an account, Log In and Logout, List Resources...

**[Part 5](http://cedric-dumont.com/tutorials/identityserver-v3-membershipreboot-angularjs-webapi-2-and-mvc-mix-it-introduction/identityserver-v3-membershipreboot-angularjs-webapi-2-and-mvc-mix-it-part-5/ "IdentityServer.v3, MembershipReboot, AngularJs, WebApi 2 and MVC : Mix It ! : Part 5"): **Creating an MVC application that will access our public Web Api using a token.

  > Thank you Cedric, very helpful post! Could you advise me, please, how to add possibility to use external IdP to this solution?

  > You mean another idp than identity server ? Identity server implements the openId specification (http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) so I think every IDP that implements that spec would work.

  > I mean how to add to this solution possibility to log in with Facebook or Google for example. Because they don't support password flow so anyway we have to redirect user to their endpoint. But what is the best way to do in your opinion: make it through Identity Server (using idp:Facebook parameter for example) or just simply redirect directly to their authorization endpoint and handle callback?

  > I have been working on the IS V3 for weeks but with no true success. It never has worked on my local host. I have published it to my server www.t3xfer.com  creating a "host" constant that can be localhost:44319 or www.t3xfer.com  >
